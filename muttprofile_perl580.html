<h1>Muttprofile and Perl 5.8.0</h1>
</div>

<p>
Muttprofile was developed using Perl version 5.005 and it also runs nicely with 
Perl 5.6.0 and Perl 5.6.1. However, I got some bug reports that muttprofile
does not work with Perl 5.8.0. So, I investigated the problem and here's what
I found and how to fix it. Please note that the problem is now history: muttprofile
works fine with Perl 5.8.1!
</p>

<h3>Symptons</h3>

<p>
The symptons are that muttprofile gives a nasty looking error message (similar to the one below) 
and messes up the terminal by loosing the line breaks.
</p>

<p>
<table bgcolor="#ccccff">
<tr>
<td><pre>
/bin/stty: invalid argument `2d00:5:bf:8a3b:3:1c:7f:15:4:0:1:0:11:13:1a:ff:12:f:17:16:ff:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0
                                                                         '
                                                                          Try `/bin/stty --help' for more information.

</pre>

It turned out that the problem was related to Perl-module <b>Term::Complete</b>
which comes with all Perl5 distributions. Muttprofile uses this module for
taking care of the interactive selection of profiles. <b>However,
muttprofile actually works despite the error!</b>
</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>
I managed to find the bug in Term::Complete and, luckily, it was easy to fix.
I contacted the Perl maintainers with a fixed version and it
was included in the Perl development tree. Fixed version is now available with
perl 5.8.1 and later.
</p>

<h3>How can I get it to work?</h3>

<p>
You have at least three options for making muttprofile work with Perl 5.8.0:
</p>

<p>
<b>Option 1:</b><br>
Look for Perl 5.8.1 and install it. It includes a new version of the Term::Complete module
which does not have the stty-problem anymore.
</p>

<p>
<b>Option 2:</b><br>
If you're stuck with 5.8.0 for some reason, you may use the following quick-and-dirty
workaround:
</p>

<p>
In your macro for calling muttprofile, add the command 'stty -raw echo' 
after the muttprofile command. This will get the line breaks back. 
If you want to get rid of the stty error too, redirect stderr to
/dev/null when calling muttprofile.
In other words use macro defition such as this:
</p>

<p>
<table bgcolor="#ccccff">
<tr>
<td><pre>
macro   index   &lt;F9&gt;     "&lt;enter-command&gt;set wait_key\n!~/bin/muttprofile 2&gt; /dev/null;stty -raw echo\n:source ~/.mutt/profile.active\n&lt;enter-command&gt;unset wait_key\n" "Call muttprofile without stty error"
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
<b>Option 3:</b><br>
Upgrade the Term::Complete-module manually. The fixed version is available <a href="http://www.acoustics.hut.fi/~mara/mutt/Complete.pm">here</a>. Remember to make a backup of the original version, just in case.
</p>

<p>
I have tested these solutions with Debian but I see no reason why they wouldn't work
on RedHat 8 or other unix systems with perl 5.8.0.
